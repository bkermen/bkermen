👋 Hi there! I’m Burçin Kermen (@bkermen)

Welcome to my GitHub! If you’re here for Business Intelligence, data visualization, or a quick laugh, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s get to know each other a bit:

👀 What I’m Into:

- Business Intelligence Analysis & Data Visualization – When I’m not unraveling insights from data, I’m probably thinking about it.
- Learning: Currently diving into Melancholin by Diary of Dreams – because everyone needs a little bit of a moody soundtrack for their day, right?

💞️ Let’s Collaborate!

I’m always up for new BI and data analysis projects! From creating dashboards that tell compelling stories to decoding cryptic data trends, I’m your data detective on demand.

📫 Connect with Me:

You can catch me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burcin-kermen), where I’m all business… well, mostly. 

⚡ Fun Fact:

When I’m not buried in code or data models, you’ll find me indulging in cats, coffee, and concerts. Follow my [Instagram](ttps://www.instagram.com/bkermen) if you’re into fluffy felines, strong brews, and live music!

- Data-driven by day, cat-driven by night.

Hope you enjoy my GitHub! Drop a star 🌟 if you like what you see, or send a message if you’d like to work together – or just swap cat photos!
